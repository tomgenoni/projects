Based in downtown San Francisco, Learn iT! has served the training needs of businesses, government agencies, and individuals since 1995. C.E.O. Damon Lembi drives a team of 52 employees dedicated to making learning efficient, valuable, and pleasurable. Learn iT! also manages a carefully selected network of nationwide instructors, allowing us to train on a national scale or for major rollouts.

Our business philosophy drives us to make life better for everyone we come in contact with. Employees and management share a commitment to innovation, teamwork, and purposeful action. We understand that Learn iT! affects the lives of those we service;  accordingly, we continuously remind ourselves to remain accountable and treat others as we would like to be treated.
