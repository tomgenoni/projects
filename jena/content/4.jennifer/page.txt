With over a decade in leadership development and education, I am adept at sensing underlying needs and issues and adapting to meet them. I am an energetic, flexible, and creative leader who is committed to the growth and success of my clients.

I hold a Masters in English Language & Literature with a focus on Linguistics from the University of Washington and graduated Phi Beta Kappa with Highest Distinction from the University of Rochester where I concentrated in English and Women’s Studies.
