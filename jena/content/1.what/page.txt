## What is Business and Corporate Coaching?

In sports, a coach challenges his or her team to achieve its goals and provides effective strategies and encouragement along the way.

Business coaching is similar.  Using a client-centered approach, the coach helps the client achieve her goals through self-discovery, challenge, encouragement, and working together to identify effective strategies for success.
